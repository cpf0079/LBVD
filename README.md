# Live Broadcasting Video Database (LBVD)
This repository is for the Live Broadcasting Video Database (LBVD), which was built collaboratively by researchers from Tencent, China, China University of Mining and Technology and Xidian University. This database is a large-scale video QoE database for mobile live broadcasting videos. 1013 samples, each lasts 10s, were collected in the database.

We are making the Live Broadcasting Video Database (LBVD) available to the research community free of charge. For more information about the LBVD dataset, please refer to the our work "QoE Evaluation for Live Broadcasting Video" published on ICIP, 2019.

If you use this database in your research, we kindly ask that you reference our papers listed below:
